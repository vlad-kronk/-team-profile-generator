## Description

As a University of Washington Coding Boot Camp student, I want to begin full stack development by utilizing Node.js to generate a full, styled HTML document that can later be served to the user. I built this as an exploration of the groundwork of full stack development. This project presents a neatly styled team directory page with information about each team member, all of which was given by the user in the command line. This project allows for easy addition or removal of team members, as it will skip the process of editing the HTML and CSS.

## Installation

'npm install' to install needed packages (inquirer, jest)

## Usage

To use the application, first run 'node index.js'. It will prompt you to select a type of employee (manager, engineer, or intern) OR exit the application and generate the HTML with all previously entered employees. After selecting an employee type, the user should enter the employee information they are asked for. Once this is done, the employee is saved within the application. The app will repeat this process until the user opts to exit the application instead of adding another employee. The HTML is saved in the ./dist directory as 'index.html'.
